# Slack-Tally-Bot
I've never created a bot before so I thought I'd try my hand at this one

A bot that can keep a tally and grab info about tally in Slack


# Things I want this bot to be able to do
  1. Start a Tally or increment existing for something with the command `/tally [name_of_tally] ++` 
      * For increment by num `/tally [name_of_tally] +[num]` to increment by `num`
      * for decrement by one  `/tally [name_of_tally] --` 
      * for decrement by num `/tally [name_of_tally] -[num]` to decrement by `num`
      * If tally does not exist prompt for creation
  2. Ask for Tally info with `/tally [name_of_tally] ` 
  3. Change the name of the tally  `/tally rename [old_tally_name] [new_tally_name]`
  
# How I'm Gonna Do It
  I have no idea. Stack Overflow?
